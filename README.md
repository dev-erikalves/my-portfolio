# My portfolio

Simple project from my portfolio created with ReactJs + Sass(Scss) with the aim of talking a little about myself, in addition to showing some of the main projects I've done and will still do!


## Learning

I felt very happy with the results I had doing this project, I know it's nothing big or different, but for me what's worth is learning, and that's certainly what I managed to do with this project, it was very good because I put a lot of things I learned in sass and with react in practice, I also know that there is much more to learn, the important thing is to continue studying and learning more and more, and this I will continue to do constantly!!!
